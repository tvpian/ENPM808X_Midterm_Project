## Overview
In recent years, because of covid pandemic, there are problems related to  the shortage of staff, and maintaining the social distancing norm in restaurant, and it becomes challenging for a restaurant business to sustain. So, to mitigate the problem we introduce the "Robo-Butler". Robo-butler is a cost-efficient fully autonomous robot that serves food to the customers' table from the kitchen in a restaurant with minimal contact thereby ensuring maximum hygiene. It localizes and track human motion to prevent potential collisions which are possible in a social environment like at the restaurants.
